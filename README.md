# Microcontroller Technology
 
This folder contains all program files which are used for the practical session about Microcontroller Technology in the course "Analog & Digital Electronic Systems" of Bachelor Aeronautical Engineering. The program will be implemented on the AVR Atmega328 of a low-cost Arduino UNO R3 kit. The lab exercise consist of two parts : schematic and simulation project created by Proteus as well as Assembly or embedded C program created by Atmel Studio 7.0. 
Students will do some lab exercises as follows : 
- Lab 1 : LED blinking (Assembly langugage - Embedded C language)
- Lab 2 : Counter display by 7-segment LED  (with or without IC7447)
- Lab 3 : Push button (polling vs interrupt)
- Lab 4 : Logic gate simulator
- Lab 5 : LCD 16x2 interface
